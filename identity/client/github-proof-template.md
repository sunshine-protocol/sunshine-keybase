### substrate identity proof

I hereby claim:

  * I am {username} on github.
  * I am {uid} on the substrate chain with genesis hash {genesis}.
  * I have a public key {public} valid at block with hash {block}.

To claim this, I am signing this object:

```json
{object}
```

with the key {public}, yielding the signature:

```
{signature}
```

And finally, I am proving ownership of the github account by posting this as a gist.
